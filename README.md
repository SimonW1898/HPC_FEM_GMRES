# Parallel Finite Element Solver for Convection-Diffusion Equations

## Project Overview

This repository showcases my work on high-performance numerical linear algebra and scientific computing, focused on solving 1D and 2D transient convection-diffusion equations using parallel programming techniques. The centerpiece is an efficient finite element method (FEM) solver for large sparse linear systems, leveraging OpenMP for shared-memory parallelization.

**Main highlights:**
- Implementation of custom sparse matrix data structures (CSR format) for memory-efficient storage and fast computation.
- Assembly of FEM system matrices from mesh and boundary input files.
- Solution of large-scale linear systems via the Generalized Minimal Residual (GMRES) iterative algorithm, including advanced features like Householder projections, Givens rotations, Jacobi preconditioning, and restart strategies.
- Rigorous benchmarking and performance analysis of parallelization efficiency and scalability.
- Comprehensive technical report (LaTeX) documenting theory, design, algorithms, results, and code.

## Scientific Problem Tackled

The core mathematical problem is the transient convection-diffusion equation:

**1D:**  
$$-D \frac{\partial^{2} c}{\partial x^{2}} - v_x \frac{\partial c}{\partial x} = \frac{\partial c}{\partial t}$$

**2D:**  
$$\frac{\partial}{\partial x}\left(D_x \frac{\partial c}{\partial x}\right) + \frac{\partial}{\partial y}\left(D_y \frac{\partial c}{\partial y}\right)- v_x \frac{\partial c}{\partial x} - v_y \frac{\partial c}{\partial y} = \frac{\partial c}{\partial t} + f$$

Discretization via FEM leads to large sparse linear systems, which are solved efficiently and accurately using advanced iterative solvers and parallelization. Boundary conditions and mesh topology are flexibly specified via input files.
